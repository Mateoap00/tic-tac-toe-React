### Main Features (Described in the tutorial)
- Functionality for the tic tac toe game.
- History back-to-move feature, returns to a move made by a player and the game could start from that point on or go back to the latest move (or any other).

### Added Features (Suggested in the tutorial for practicing)
- Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.

- Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

## What skills I learned developing this project?
